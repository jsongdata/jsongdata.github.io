## Background

Hi, I am Jaekuk. I graduated from Ohio State University with a B.S. in Data Analytics. I am currently seeking a full-time position in Data Analytics or Data Science, or an internship related to Large Language Models (LLMs). Outside of work, I enjoy working out, eating, and reading technical articles.

## What did I do at Ohio State University?

I took 4 math, 7 statistics, and 9 computer science classes, and I also held 2 research assistant positions. Through these experiences, I built a strong foundation to become a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and potentially an LLM Engineer. However, the most valuable lesson I learned was collaborating with others and realizing how powerful teamwork can be.
