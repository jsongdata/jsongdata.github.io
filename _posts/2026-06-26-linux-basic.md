I created these notes as a structured recap of Linux fundamentals. While following the video course, I installed the environment myself, typed each command in the terminal, and documented what I learned through hands-on practice.

I am grateful to the instructor for making the course freely available, allowing learners like me to study with little more than the cost of internet access. I have used a similar approach to revisit Python through four complete courses taught by different instructors. Each course gave me an opportunity to understand familiar concepts from a new perspective.

<summary><strong>Note 1: Setting Up a Linux Practice Environment</strong></summary>

## Downloading VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a virtualization tool that allows one computer to run another operating system inside a virtual machine. In this setup, Windows acts as the **host** operating system, and Ubuntu runs as the **guest** operating system.

## Downloading Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution that is commonly used for learning, desktop use, servers, and cloud environments. I downloaded the Ubuntu Desktop ISO file and used it as the installer inside VirtualBox.

</p>

### What Is an ISO File?

An ISO file is a disk image used to install an operating system. In a physical setup, an operating system might be installed from a DVD or USB drive. In VirtualBox, the ISO file can be attached like a virtual installation disk.

## Installing VirtualBox

After downloading the installer, I launched the VirtualBox setup wizard and continued with the default installation options. The installer includes components such as the main VirtualBox application, USB support, and networking support.

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">

</p>

### Why These Components Matter

- VirtualBox Networking allows the guest operating system to connect to networks.
- VirtualBox USB Support allows USB devices to be used inside virtual machines.
- The default installation options are usually enough for a beginner Linux lab.

## Creating a Virtual Machine and Allocating Resources

After installing VirtualBox, I created a new virtual machine for Ubuntu. I selected Linux as the operating system type and Ubuntu as the version. Then I configured the amount of memory and storage assigned to the virtual machine.

One important part of this lecture was understanding how to allocate **RAM**.

### RAM Allocation

RAM is the memory used while the virtual machine is running. When I assign RAM to Ubuntu in VirtualBox, that memory comes from the physical computer.

- If I assign too little RAM, Ubuntu may run slowly.
- If I assign too much RAM, the host operating system may become slow.
- For a basic Ubuntu lab, 2 GB or more is usually enough for simple practice.
- The best setting depends on how much total RAM the physical computer has.

```text
Host OS: the main operating system running on the physical computer
Guest OS: the operating system running inside the virtual machine
```

## Creating a Virtual Hard Disk

A virtual machine does not use a physical hard drive directly. Instead, it stores its operating system and files inside a virtual disk file. In this lecture, I created a virtual disk named `Linux.vdi` and assigned it 10 GB of storage.

<img src="/assets/img/linux-basic/04-virtual-disk-size.png" width="650" alt="VirtualBox virtual hard disk size screen">

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">
  Creating a virtual hard disk for the Ubuntu virtual machine
</p>

### VDI

VDI stands for Virtual Disk Image. It is the virtual hard disk format used by VirtualBox. To the Ubuntu guest operating system, the VDI file appears like a normal hard drive.

## Booting Ubuntu

After creating the virtual machine and attaching the Ubuntu ISO file, I started the machine. The Ubuntu boot screen appeared inside the VirtualBox window.

<img src="/assets/img/linux-basic/05-ubuntu-boot.png" width="800" alt="Ubuntu boot screen in VirtualBox">

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">
  Ubuntu booting inside Oracle VM VirtualBox
</p>

The bottom-right corner shows `Right Control`, which is the VirtualBox Host Key. It can be used to release keyboard or mouse control from the virtual machine back to the host computer.

## Ubuntu Installation Screen

The Ubuntu installer provides two main choices: `Try Ubuntu` and `Install Ubuntu`.

<img src="/assets/img/linux-basic/06-ubuntu-installer.png" width="800" alt="Ubuntu installer welcome screen">

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">
  Ubuntu installation welcome screen
</p>

### Try Ubuntu vs. Install Ubuntu

- `Try Ubuntu`: runs Ubuntu temporarily without installing it.
- `Install Ubuntu`: installs Ubuntu onto the virtual hard disk.

For this lab, I selected `Install Ubuntu` so I could create a reusable Linux practice environment.

## Ubuntu Login Screen

After the installation completed, the virtual machine rebooted into Ubuntu and displayed the login screen. From here, I could select the user account and sign in to the Ubuntu desktop.

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">

</p>

The message at the top indicates that the guest operating system supports mouse integration. This makes it easier to move the mouse between the host operating system and the virtual machine.

<summary><strong>Note 2: Basic Terminal Commands and Command History</strong></summary>

## Printing Text with `echo`

```bash
echo "Hello, Linux"
```

```text
Hello, Linux
```

## Checking Time Settings with `timedatectl`

The `timedatectl` command displays the system clock and time configuration managed by `systemd`.

```bash
timedatectl
```

Its output can include:

- **Local time:** the current time in the configured time zone.
- **Universal time:** the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
- **RTC time:** the hardware real-time clock value.
- **Time zone:** the system's configured geographic time zone.
- **System clock synchronized:** whether the system clock is synchronized.
- **NTP service:** whether network-based time synchronization is active.

This command is useful when checking a Linux machine's time zone or diagnosing incorrect system time.

## Clearing the Terminal with `clear`

```bash
clear
```

## Viewing Previous Commands with `history`

```bash
history
```

Example:

```text
1  echo "Hello, Linux"
2  timedatectl
3  clear
4  history
```

Command history is useful for reviewing previous work, finding a long command, and avoiding unnecessary retyping.

## Recalling Commands with the Up Arrow Key

Pressing the **Up Arrow** key recalls an earlier command at the prompt. Pressing it repeatedly moves backward through the command history.

```text
Press Up Arrow -> review the command -> edit if needed -> press Enter
```

This method is useful when I want to inspect or modify a previous command before running it again.

## Repeating the Last Command with `!!`

The `!!` history expansion runs the immediately preceding command again.

```bash
echo "Hello, Linux"
```

```text
Hello, Linux
```

```bash
!!
```

```text
Hello, Linux
```

<summary><strong>Note 4: Manual Commands</strong></summary>

## 1. Open a Command Manual

```bash
man ls
```

```text
LS(1)                     User Commands                    LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

`man` opens the manual page for a command. Press `q` to exit the manual.

## 2. List Directory Contents

```bash
ls
```

```text
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

`ls` displays visible files and directories in the current directory.

## 3. Include Hidden Files

```bash
ls -a
```

```text
.  ..  .bash_history  .bashrc  .cache  .config
.local  .profile  .ssh  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

`-a` means `--all`. It includes entries whose names begin with `.`, including hidden files.

## 4. Use the Long Option

```bash
ls --all
```

```text
.  ..  .bash_history  .bashrc  .cache  .config
.local  .profile  .ssh  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

`--all` is the long form of `-a` and produces the same result.

## 5. Open the Calendar Manual

```bash
man cal
```

```text
CAL(1)                    User Commands                   CAL(1)

NAME
       cal, ncal - display a calendar and the date of Easter

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
```

The manual shows the syntax and available options for `cal`.

## 6. Search Manual Descriptions

```bash
man -k calendar
```

```text
cal (1)  - displays a calendar and the date of Easter
ncal (1) - displays a calendar and the date of Easter
```

`man -k` searches command names and manual descriptions for a keyword. It is equivalent to `apropos`.

## 7. Search for the Keyword `directory`

```bash
man -k directory
```

```text
basename (1) - strip directory and suffix from filenames
chdir (1)    - change working directory
dir (1)      - list directory contents
find (1)     - search for files in a directory hierarchy
ls (1)       - list directory contents
mkdir (1)    - make directories
pwd (1)      - print name of current/working directory
...
```

The search can return many commands from different manual sections. The number in parentheses identifies the manual section.

## 8. Display Three Months

```bash
cal -3
```

```text
     June 2021          July 2021         August 2021

27 28 29 30           25 26 27 28 29 30 31  29 30 31
```

`-3` displays the previous, current, and next month.

## 9. Display Three Months with Julian Days

```bash
cal -3 -j
```

```text
       June 2021             July 2021            August 2021
Su  Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa  Su  Mo  Tu  We  Th  Fr  Sa
        152 153 154 155 156              182 183 184
157 158 159 160 161 162 163 185 186 187 188 189 190 191
164 165 166 167 168 169 170 192 193 194 195 196 197 198
171 172 173 174 175 176 177 199 200 201 202 203 204 205
178 179 180 181             206 207 208 209 210 211 212
```

`-j` displays each date as its day number within the year.

## 10. Combine Short Options

```bash
cal -3j
```

```text
[The same three-month Julian-day calendar is displayed.]
```

Short options can be combined. `-3j` is equivalent to `-3 -j`.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Note 5: Input and Output</strong></summary>

Linux commands use three standard data streams:

```text
0 = standard input  (stdin)
1 = standard output (stdout)
2 = standard error  (stderr)
```

## 1. Read Standard Input with `cat`

```bash
cat
```

```text
hello
hello
linux
linux
^C
```

With no filename, `cat` reads standard input and copies each line to standard output. Each entered line appears twice: once as keyboard input and once as `cat` output. `Ctrl+C` interrupts the command; `Ctrl+D` ends input normally.

## 2. Redirect Standard Output with `1>`

```bash
cat 1> output.txt
```

```text
hello
linux
^C
```

`1>` redirects standard output to `output.txt`. The entered lines are saved in the file instead of being printed again by `cat`.

```text
hello
linux
```

## 3. Use `>` as the Standard Output Shortcut

```bash
cat > output.txt
```

```text
hello2
linux2
^C
```

`>` is equivalent to `1>`. It overwrites the existing contents of `output.txt`.

```text
hello2
linux2
```

## 4. Append Output with `>>`

```bash
cat >> output.txt
```

```text
hello3
linux3
^C
```

`>>` adds new output to the end of the file without deleting its current contents.

```text
hello2
linux2
hello3
linux3
```

## 5. List the Current Directory

```bash
ls
```

```text
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  output.txt
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

`ls` writes the directory listing to standard output.

## 6. Save the Directory Listing

```bash
ls > list.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The directory listing is redirected to `list.txt` instead of the terminal.

## 7. Redirect Standard Input with `0<`

```bash
cat 0< output.txt
```

```text
hello2
linux2
hello3
linux3
```

`0<` connects `output.txt` to standard input. `cat` reads the file and writes its contents to standard output.

## 8. Use `<` as the Standard Input Shortcut

```bash
cat < output.txt
```

```text
hello2
linux2
hello3
linux3
```

`<` is equivalent to `0<`.

## 9. Pass the Filename as an Argument

```bash
cat output.txt
```

```text
hello2
linux2
hello3
linux3
```

This produces the same visible result, but `output.txt` is passed directly to `cat` as a filename rather than through input redirection.

## 10. Display an Error

```bash
cat -aaa
```

```text
cat: invalid option -- 'a'
Try 'cat --help' for more information.
```

The invalid option message is written to standard error, not standard output.

## 11. Redirect Standard Error with `2>`

```bash
cat -aaa 2> error.txt
```

```text
[No terminal error output]
```

`2>` redirects standard error to `error.txt`.

```text
cat: invalid option -- 'a'
Try 'cat --help' for more information.
```

## Redirection Summary

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0<` or `<` | Read standard input from a file |
| `1>` or `>` | Write standard output to a file and overwrite it |
| `>>` | Append standard output to a file |
| `2>` | Write standard error to a file |

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Note 6: Piping Commands</strong></summary>

The examples below use a date format in which the year is the first space-separated field. The exact `date` output depends on the system locale.

## 1. Display the Current Date

```bash
date
```

```text
2021. 07. 18. (Sun) 19:01:18 KST
```

`date` writes the current date and time to standard output.

## 2. Redirect Standard Output to a File

```bash
date 1> date.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`1>` redirects file descriptor `1`, which is standard output, to `date.txt`. It creates the file or overwrites its existing contents.

## 3. Read a File and Extract Its First Field

```bash
cut < date.txt --delimiter " " --field 1
```

```text
2021.
```

- `< date.txt` sends the file to the command's standard input.
- `--delimiter " "` separates the input at each space.
- `--field 1` selects the first field.

## 4. Pipe `date` Directly into `cut`

```bash
date | cut --delimiter " " --field 1
```

```text
2021.
```

`|` sends the standard output of `date` directly to the standard input of `cut`. This produces the same result without an intermediate file.

## 5. Pipe the Result and Save It

```bash
date | cut --delimiter " " --field 1 > date.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`cut` extracts the first field, and `>` saves that processed result to `date.txt`. The file now contains:

```text
2021.
```

## 6. Run the Pipeline Again

```bash
date | cut --delimiter " " --field 1
```

```text
2021.
```

Without the final `> date.txt`, the processed result is displayed in the terminal.

## 7. Redirection Before a Pipe

```bash
date > year.txt | cut --delimiter " " --field 1
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`>` sends the output of `date` to `year.txt` before `cut` can receive it. The file contains the full date, but `cut` receives no input from the pipe.

## 8. Save and Pipe the Same Output with `tee`

```bash
date | tee year.txt | cut --delimiter " " --field 1
```

```text
2021.
```

`tee` duplicates the incoming data:

- One copy is saved to `year.txt`.
- The other copy continues through the pipe to `cut`.

The terminal displays the first field, while `year.txt` stores the full date.

## Data Flow Summary

```text
date -> standard output -> pipe -> cut -> terminal
```

```text
date -> pipe -> tee -> year.txt
                    -> pipe -> cut -> terminal
```

<summary><strong>Note 7: Linux Files and Directory Structure</strong></summary>

## Linux Directory Hierarchy

Linux uses a single directory tree that begins at the root directory, `/`.

<img src="/assets/img/linux-basic/09-linux-directory-structure.png" width="900" alt="Linux directory hierarchy from the root directory">

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center; color: #666;">
  A simplified Linux directory structure
</p>

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | The root of the entire filesystem |
| `/bin` | Essential command binaries |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/home` | Personal directories for regular users |
| `/opt` | Optional third-party software |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/usr` | User applications, libraries, and shared data |
| `/usr/bin` | Most user commands |
| `/usr/lib` | Libraries used by programs |
| `/var` | Frequently changing data |
| `/var/log` | System and application logs |

For example, `/home/user/Documents` starts at `/`, enters `home`, then the user's home directory, and finally `Documents`.

## 1. Print the Current Directory

```bash
pwd
```

```text
/home/user
```

`pwd` means **print working directory**. It displays the absolute path of the current location.

## 2. List the Current Directory

```bash
ls
```

```text
a.txt  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

With no path, `ls` displays the contents of the current directory.

## 3. List a Directory by Absolute Path

```bash
ls /home/user
```

```text
a.txt  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

An absolute path begins with `/`. This command lists `/home/user` regardless of the current location.

## 4. Display a Long Listing

```bash
ls -l
```

```text
total 32
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user    0 Jul 19 14:34 a.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jul 18 12:35 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jul 18 12:35 Documents
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jul 18 19:43 Downloads
```

`-l` displays one entry per line with detailed metadata:

```text
permissions  links  owner  group  size  modified time  name
```

- The first character is `d` for a directory or `-` for a regular file.
- The remaining `rwx` characters show read, write, and execute permissions.

## 5. Display Human-Readable Sizes

```bash
ls -l -h
```

```text

`-h` makes sizes easier to read by using units such as `K`, `M`, and `G`.

## 6. Include Hidden Files

```bash
ls -a
```

```text
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .config
.local  .profile  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

Files beginning with `.` are hidden from a normal `ls` listing. `-a` includes them.

## 7. Combine Hidden and Long Listings

```bash
ls -a -l
```

```text
total 96
drwxr-x--- 16 user user 4096 Jul 19 14:34 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jul 18 12:35 ..
-rw-------  1 user user  ... Jul 19 14:34 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 user user  ... Jul 18 12:35 .bashrc
...
```

Multiple options can be used together. `ls -a -l` can also be written as `ls -al`.

## 8. Enter a Child Directory

```bash
cd Downloads
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user/Downloads]
```

`cd` means **change directory**. `Downloads` is a relative path because it starts from the current directory.

```bash
ls
```

```text
linuxdir.JPG
```

The file is inside `/home/user/Downloads`.

## 9. Move to the Parent Directory

```bash
cd ..
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user]
```

`..` represents the parent of the current directory.

```bash
ls
```

```text
a.txt  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music
Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

## 10. Move Up to `/home`

```bash
cd ..
```

```text
[Working directory: /home]
```

```bash
ls
```

```text
user
```

`/home` contains the home directories of regular users.

## 11. Move Up to the Root Directory

```bash
cd ..
```

```text
[Working directory: /]
```

```bash
ls
```

```text
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  media  mnt  opt
proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

`/` is the highest directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy.

## 12. Use a Relative Path from Root

```bash
cd etc
```

```text
[Working directory: /etc]
```

Because the current directory was `/`, the relative name `etc` resolves to `/etc`.

## 13. Use Absolute Paths

```bash
cd /home/user
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user]
```

```bash
cd /etc
```

```text
[Working directory: /etc]
```

Absolute paths begin with `/` and work from any current directory.

## 14. Return to the Home Directory

```bash
cd
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user]
```

Running `cd` without an argument returns to the current user's home directory.

## 15. Navigate with Directory Names

```bash
cd Desktop/
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user/Desktop]
```

```bash
cd ..
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user]
```

```bash
cd Downloads/
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user/Downloads]
```

A trailing `/` is optional when the path identifies a directory.

## Path Summary

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/home/user` | Absolute path to the user's home |
| `Downloads` | Relative path from the current directory |
| `.` | Current directory |
| `..` | Parent directory |
| `~` | Current user's home directory |

<summary><strong>Note 8: Creating and Deleting Files and Directories</strong></summary>

## 1. Create an Empty File

```bash
touch file.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`touch` creates an empty file when the file does not exist. If it already exists, `touch` updates its timestamp without deleting its contents.

## 2. Create a File with Text

```bash
echo "linux" > linux.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`echo` produces the text, and `>` writes it to `linux.txt`. The file contains:

```text
linux
```

`>` creates the file or overwrites its existing contents.

## 3. Create a Directory

```bash
mkdir korea
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`mkdir` creates a directory named `korea` in the current working directory.

## 4. Confirm the Current Location

```bash
pwd
```

```text
/home/user
```

The following relative paths begin from `/home/user`.

## 5. Create a Directory with an Absolute Path

```bash
mkdir /home/user/busan
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The absolute path creates `busan` directly inside `/home/user`.

## 6. Attempt to Create a Nested Directory

```bash
mkdir china/shanghai
```

```text
mkdir: cannot create directory 'china/shanghai': No such file or directory
```

This fails because the parent directory `china` does not exist.

## 7. Create Missing Parent Directories

```bash
mkdir -p china/shanghai
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`-p` creates any missing parent directories. It creates `china` first and then `shanghai` inside it.

## 8. Create Multiple Directories

```bash
mkdir seoul gangnam
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

Separate arguments create two directories: `seoul` and `gangnam`.

## 9. Create One Directory Containing a Space

```bash
mkdir "seoul gangnam"
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

Quotation marks keep the words together as one directory name: `seoul gangnam`.

## 10. Delete One File

```bash
rm file.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`rm` permanently removes a file. It does not normally move the file to a trash folder.

## 11. Create Multiple Files

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

One `touch` command can create multiple files by passing multiple filenames.

## 12. Delete Multiple Files by Name

```bash
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

One `rm` command can remove multiple explicitly named files.

## 13. Delete Files with a Pattern

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

```bash
rm file*.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`*` is a shell wildcard. `file*.txt` matches `.txt` files whose names begin with `file`.

## 14. Delete All Matching Text Files

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

```bash
rm *.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`*.txt` matches every visible filename ending in `.txt` in the current directory. The pattern should be checked carefully before deletion.

## 15. Attempt to Delete a Directory with `rm`

```bash
rm seoul
```

```text
rm: cannot remove 'seoul': Is a directory
```

Plain `rm` does not remove a directory.

## 16. Delete a Directory Recursively

```bash
rm -r seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`-r` recursively removes the directory and everything inside it.

## 17. Enter an Empty Directory

```bash
cd busan
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user/busan]
```

```bash
ls
```

```text
[No files]
```

The new `busan` directory is empty.

## 18. Create and Verify a File

```bash
touch file.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

```bash
ls
```

```text
file.txt
```

The file now exists inside `/home/user/busan`.

## 19. Remove a Directory by Absolute Path

```bash
rm -r /home/user/busan
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

This removes `busan` and `file.txt` even though the shell is currently inside that directory. The prompt may temporarily continue to display the deleted path.

```bash
cd ..
```

```text
[Working directory: /home/user]
```

Moving to the parent returns the shell to an existing directory.

## 20. Verify the Remaining Directories

```bash
ls
```

```text
china  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  gangnam  korea
Music  Pictures  Public  "seoul gangnam"  Templates  Videos
```

`busan` and `seoul` are gone. `china`, `korea`, `gangnam`, and `seoul gangnam` remain.

## Command Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `touch file` | Create an empty file or update its timestamp |
| `mkdir directory` | Create a directory |
| `mkdir -p path` | Create nested directories and missing parents |
| `rm file` | Delete a file |
| `rm -r directory` | Recursively delete a directory |
| `*` | Match multiple filenames |

> `rm -r` and wildcard patterns can delete many files permanently. Verify the path and pattern before pressing Enter.

<summary><strong>Note 9: Copying and Moving Files and Directories</strong></summary>

## 1. Create a Source File

```bash
touch file1.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

This creates an empty file named `file1.txt`.

## 2. Copy and Rename a File

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`cp` copies the source to the destination. `file1.txt` remains, and a separate copy named `file2.txt` is created.

```text
file1.txt
file2.txt
```

## 3. Create a Destination Directory

```bash
mkdir seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The `seoul` directory will be used as the copy destination.

## 4. Copy a File Using a Relative Path

```bash
cp file1.txt ./seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`./seoul` refers to the `seoul` directory inside the current directory.

```text
seoul/file1.txt
```

## 5. Copy a File Using an Absolute Path

```bash
cp file2.txt /home/user/seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The absolute destination path works regardless of the current directory.

```text
/home/user/seoul/file2.txt
```

## 6. Copy Multiple Files with a Wildcard

```bash
cp *.txt ./seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`*.txt` matches every visible `.txt` file in the current directory. Matching files are copied into `seoul`.

```text
seoul/file1.txt
seoul/file2.txt
```

Existing files with the same names may be overwritten.

## 7. Create Another Directory

```bash
mkdir busan
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

This creates an empty directory named `busan`.

## 8. Copy a Directory Recursively

```bash
cp -r busan ./seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

`-r` recursively copies a directory and everything inside it.

```text
seoul/busan/
```

Plain `cp` copies files; copying directories requires `cp -r`.

## 9. Rename a File with `mv`

```bash
mv file1.txt file9.txt
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

When the destination is a new name in the same directory, `mv` renames the file.

```text
file1.txt -> file9.txt
```

## 10. Rename a Directory with `mv`

```bash
mv busan daegu
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The original `busan` directory is renamed to `daegu`.

```text
busan/ -> daegu/
```

The copied directory `seoul/busan` is separate and keeps its original name.

## 11. Move a File into a Directory

```bash
mv file2.txt ./daegu
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

Because `daegu` is an existing directory, `file2.txt` is moved inside it.

```text
daegu/file2.txt
```

The original `file2.txt` no longer exists in the current directory.

## 12. Attempt to Move a Misspelled Directory

```bash
mv deagu ./seoul
```

```text
mv: cannot stat 'deagu': No such file or directory
```

The command fails because `deagu` is misspelled. The existing directory is named `daegu`.

## 13. Move the Correct Directory

```bash
mv daegu ./seoul
```

```text
[No terminal output]
```

The `daegu` directory and its contents move inside `seoul`.

```text
seoul/
├── busan/
├── daegu/
│   └── file2.txt
├── file1.txt
└── file2.txt
```

## `cp` vs. `mv`

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `cp source destination` | Copies a file and keeps the original |
| `cp -r source destination` | Copies a directory recursively |
| `mv source new-name` | Renames a file or directory |
| `mv source directory` | Moves a file or directory to another location |

> `cp` and `mv` can overwrite an existing destination with the same name. Verify the destination before running the command.

<summary><strong>Note 10: Using the Nano Editor</strong></summary>

GNU Nano is a terminal-based text editor. Its main keyboard shortcuts are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

```text
^ = Ctrl
M- = Alt or Meta
```

For example, `^O` means `Ctrl+O`, and `M-U` means `Alt+U`.

## 1. Open or Create a File

```bash
nano file.txt
```

```text
[Nano opens file.txt in the terminal]
```

- If `file.txt` exists, Nano loads its contents.
- If it does not exist, Nano opens an empty buffer and creates the file when it is saved.

## 2. Edit the Text Buffer

Text can be entered directly at the cursor position.

```text
Hello

Linux

a
a
a
```

The filename appears in the title bar. An asterisk after the filename means the buffer has unsaved changes:

```text
file.txt *
```

## 3. Save with Write Out

```text
Ctrl+O
```

```text
File Name to Write: file.txt
```

`Ctrl+O` opens the **Write Out** prompt. Press `Enter` to confirm the filename and save the buffer.

```text
[Wrote the file to file.txt]
```

After saving, the `*` disappears from the title bar.

## 4. Exit Nano

```text
Ctrl+X
```

```text
[Nano closes and returns to the shell]
```

If unsaved changes exist, Nano asks whether to save them:

```text
Save modified buffer?
Y = Yes
N = No
Ctrl+C = Cancel
```

## 5. Verify and Reopen the File

```bash
ls
```

```text
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  file.txt  Pictures
Public  seoul  Templates  Videos
```

The saved file now appears in the directory listing.

```bash
nano file.txt
```

```text
[Nano reopens the saved contents of file.txt]
```

## 6. Insert Another File

```text
Ctrl+R
```

```text
File to insert [from ./]: /etc/crontab
```

`Ctrl+R` activates **Read File**. After entering `/etc/crontab` and pressing `Enter`, Nano inserts that file's contents at the current cursor position.

```text
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
SHELL=/bin/sh
...
```

The inserted text becomes part of the current buffer. It does not switch the editor to `/etc/crontab`.

## 7. Search for Text

```text
Ctrl+W
```

```text
Search: system
```

`Ctrl+W`, shown as **Where Is**, searches forward for matching text. Enter the search term and press `Enter`.

```text
[Cursor moves to the next occurrence of "system"]
```

Use `Alt+W` for the next match and `Alt+Q` for the previous match.

## 8. Search and Replace

```text
Ctrl+\
```

```text
Search (to replace): system
```

Enter the replacement text:

```text
Replace with: server
```

Nano then asks whether to replace the match. The user can replace one occurrence or all matching occurrences.

```text
system -> server
```

## 9. Cut, Copy, and Paste

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+K` | Cut the current line or selected text |
| `Ctrl+U` | Paste the most recently cut or copied text |
| `Alt+A` | Start or end a text selection |
| `Alt+6` | Copy selected text without removing it |

To copy a block:

```text
Alt+A -> move the cursor -> Alt+6 -> Ctrl+U
```

## 10. Undo and Redo

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt+U` | Undo the previous edit |
| `Alt+E` | Redo an undone edit |

These shortcuts are useful after accidental changes.

## 11. Navigate the Buffer

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys | Move the cursor |
| `Ctrl+B` | Move backward one character |
| `Ctrl+F` | Move forward one character |
| `Alt+Space` | Move to the previous word |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Move to the next word |
| `Ctrl+C` | Show the current cursor location |
| `Ctrl+_` | Go to a specific line and column |
| `Alt+]` | Move to the matching bracket |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Return to the previous cursor position |

## 12. Other Visible Nano Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Nano Label | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Ctrl+G` | Help | Open Nano help |
| `Ctrl+O` | Write Out | Save the current buffer |
| `Ctrl+R` | Read File | Insert another file |
| `Ctrl+W` | Where Is | Search for text |
| `Ctrl+\` | Replace | Search and replace text |
| `Ctrl+T` | Execute | Run a command or tool |
| `Ctrl+J` | Justify | Reformat the current paragraph |
| `Ctrl+X` | Exit | Close Nano |

## Basic Nano Workflow

```text
nano file.txt
-> enter or edit text
-> Ctrl+O
-> Enter
-> Ctrl+X
```

This workflow opens a file, saves the changes, and exits the editor.

<summary><strong>Note 12: File Archiving and Compression</strong></summary>

## 1. Check the Source Files

```bash
ls
```

```text
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
```

These three text files will be archived and compressed.

## 2. Create a TAR Archive

```bash
tar -cvf tararchive.tar file*.txt
```

```text
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
```

`tar` combines multiple files into one archive:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-c` | Create a new archive |
| `-v` | Display processed filenames |
| `-f` | Use the following archive filename |

`file*.txt` matches the three text files. A plain `.tar` file archives them but does not compress their contents.

## 3. Verify the TAR File

```bash
ls
```

```text
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  tararchive.tar
```

The source files remain, and `tararchive.tar` is created.

## 4. List TAR Archive Contents

```bash
tar -tf tararchive.tar
```

```text
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
```

`-t` lists archive contents without extracting them. `-f` identifies the archive file.

## 5. Extract a TAR Archive

```bash
tar -xvf tararchive.tar
```

```text
file1.txt
file2.txt
file3.txt
```

`-x` extracts the archive, while `-v` displays each extracted filename.

```bash
ls
```

```text
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  tararchive.tar
```

The extracted files appear in the current directory. Existing files with the same names may be overwritten.

## 6. Create a ZIP Archive

```bash
zip ziparchive.zip file*.txt
```

```text
  adding: file1.txt (deflated 56%)
  adding: file2.txt (deflated 56%)
  adding: file3.txt (deflated 56%)
```

`zip` creates a compressed archive. `deflated 56%` indicates that compression reduced the file's stored size.

## 7. Verify the ZIP File

```bash
ls
```

```text
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt  tararchive.tar  ziparchive.zip
```

The directory now contains both the TAR archive and the compressed ZIP archive.

## 8. Attempt an Incorrect Extraction Command

```bash
uzip ziparchive.zip
```

```text
Command 'uzip' not found, but there are similar commands.
```

The command fails because `uzip` is a spelling error.

## 9. Extract the ZIP Archive

```bash
unzip ziparchive.zip
```

```text
Archive:  ziparchive.zip
  inflating: file1.txt
  inflating: file2.txt
  inflating: file3.txt
```

`unzip` extracts files from a `.zip` archive. It may ask for confirmation when files with the same names already exist.

## TAR vs. ZIP

| Format | Purpose | Compression |
|---|---|---|
| `.tar` | Combines files into one archive | None by default |
| `.zip` | Combines and compresses files | Yes |

TAR can also use compression options:

```bash
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz file*.txt
```

```text
[Creates a gzip-compressed TAR archive]
```

Here, `-z` applies gzip compression.

## Command Summary

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tar -cvf archive.tar files` | Create a TAR archive |
| `tar -tf archive.tar` | List TAR contents |
| `tar -xvf archive.tar` | Extract a TAR archive |
| `zip archive.zip files` | Create a ZIP archive |
| `unzip archive.zip` | Extract a ZIP archive |
