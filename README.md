# Welcome to My Portfolio Website  

## Background  

After being admitted to Georgia Techâ€™s OMSCS program, I started collecting information about future courses from helpful blogs. While doing so, I came across several blogs with themes that caught my eye. I reached out to some of their authors through LinkedIn for advice, and I received a reply from **Yi Xiang Low**, who currently works at Google as a Senior Engineering Analyst. I really appreciate his response.  

## Takeaways  

While following the steps he provided, I faced several challenges, such as:  

- Learning GitHub (creating a repository, generating a token, forking, and managing it on my own)  
- Setting up Jekyll  
- Resolving Ruby version mismatches (due to MacOS default version)  
- Learning Git commands  

As I expected, problems in the CLI required the most effort and patience to overcome. In the end, I successfully built and deployed my own website, and I am glad to have learned these skills.
